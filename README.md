# WP-Findery

_Allows for shortcode embedding of [Findery](http://findery.com) notes in Wordpress blogs._

## Usage

WP-Findery provides several ways to embed Findery content in your Wordpress blog.

### Method 1: Link

Simply pasting a link to a Findery note in the Wordpress editor will automatically embed the note in your blog.

```https://findery.com/caterina/notes/the-giants-causeway```

### Method 2: Shortcode

Use a link, similar to the method above, inside of a Findery shortcode. You may optionally specify a width and height when using this method.

```[findery https://findery.com/caterina/notes/the-giants-causeway]```

```[findery https://findery.com/caterina/notes/the-giants-causeway w="100%" h="400"]```

### Method 3: Embed code

If you visit the page for any note on Findery, you will find an 'Embed' button that will provide you with code to embed that note. Copy and paste that code into the Wordpress editor, and WP-Findery will automatically convert the code into a shortcode.
